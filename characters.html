        <p>At a young age, Luffy admired the pirates led by "Red Haired" Shanks. He accidentally ate the Paramecia-type Gum-Gum Fruit (ゴムゴムの実, Gomu Gomu no Mi), gaining rubbery attributes.

        <p>After two years of training on a secluded island, Luffy returns with advanced abilities and sets his sights on the New World.</p>

        <h2>Nami</h2>
        <img src="nami.jpg" alt="Nami">
        <p>Nami (ナミ) was adopted and raised by Belle-Mère, a former navy seaman turned tangerine farmer. Her mother was tragically murdered by the infamous pirate Arlong, who occupied their island and extorted the population.</p>
        <p>As a child, Nami struck a deal with Arlong and joined his pirates to eventually buy freedom for her village. Despite being a pirate-hating pirate, she developed exceptional skills in cartography, navigation, and weather forecasting.</p>
        <p>After Arlong's defeat by the Straw Hat Pirates, Nami pursued her dream of creating a complete map of the world. She became known as "Cat Burglar" Nami (泥棒猫のナミ) and joined the Straw Hat Pirates.</p>

        <h2>Usopp</h2>
        <img src="usopp.jpg" alt="Usopp">
        <p>Usopp (ウソップ) was abandoned by his father, Yasopp, during his early childhood when Yasopp joined the Red-Haired Pirates. Usopp's mother, Bachina, fell ill, and he started telling tall tales, hoping that his father would return and take them out to sea. He often visited Kaya, a friend from the mansion atop the hill where he lived.</p>
        <p>Even after his mother's death, Usopp didn't blame his father for leaving. Despite being cowardly, he aspired to become a great pirate.</p>
        <p>Usopp is known for his distinctive long nose, a result of his tendency to exaggerate. He is a skilled inventor, painter, and sculptor. In combat, he uses slingshots with great precision and a unique fighting style known as "The Usopp Arsenal."</p>
        <p>Under his alter-ego "Sogeking, the King of Snipers," he helps the Straw Hats on various adventures. He later becomes known as "God" Usopp after assisting in the liberation of Dressrosa from Donquixote Doflamingo's rule.</p>
